# Welcome to the SmartWave Demos Repository!

This repository serves as a centralized hub for all configuration files utilized in our demos, providing an organized collection for easy access. Additionally, you'll find datasheets for the various modules employed in our demonstrations. Explore the media folder to access schematics and hardware setups featured in each demo.

If you haven't delved into our articles about [SmartWave](https://www.semify-eda.com/blog), we encourage you to do so for a comprehensive understanding. If you find the content intriguing, consider [acquiring](https://www.semify-eda.com/smartwave) a SmartWave for yourself to continue your exploration. Happy coding!

Check out the "stepper_demo" folder for a standalone project. It uses our [EX-MotorShield8874](https://www.semify-eda.com/ex-motorshield8874) to control a stepper motor with SmartWave via I2C. Feel free to explore and give it a try!
